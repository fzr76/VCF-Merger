# VCF-Merger
I noticed a need for a program to quickly merge vcf files into one single vcf file for moving contacts between iPhones with my windows machine at work.
This was because I use Anytrans to pull contacts from iPhones and it splits them for some reason. Then when I go to import them to another iPhone it will
only accept one file. Hence the need to merge all of the files.
This program takes advantage of the windows cmd copy command. And the cat command on linux and mac.
I also wanted to play around with making a very basic GUI so that it is easy to use for anyone.
