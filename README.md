# VCF-Merger
I noticed a need for a program to quickly merge vcf files into one single vcf file for moving contacts between iPhones with my windows machine at work.
This program takes advantage of the windows cmd copy command.
I also wanted to play around with making a very basic GUI so that it is easy to use for anyone.
Provided in this repo is a .rar with the program ready to go without the need to download python.
